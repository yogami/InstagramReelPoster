Soft warm lighting bathes the scene, creating a serene atmosphere. The composition uses rule of thirds, placing the subject slightly off-center. Rich natural color grading enhances the warm sunset tones. Background shows gentle mist rolling through distant peaks, adding depth. Person wears simple earth-toned clothing, hands resting gently on knees in classic mudra position. Hero prop: meditation cushion with subtle texture. The scene evokes tranquility and inner peace through careful attention to lighting quality and environmental calm.",

Now a close-up shot with 85mm lens captures the subject's serene face in profile, eyes gently closed. The same soft warm golden-hour lighting continues, creating a glow on peaceful features. Composition centers the face using centered framing for intimacy. The meditation cushion remains visible but softly blurred in foreground. Warm filmic color grading preserves the sunset palette. Background mountains fade into gentle bokeh, emphasizing inner calm. Person's earth-toned clothing drapes naturally, hands still in mudra.

Now a wide shot with 35mm lens reveals the full environment - the meditating figure small but centered against vast mountain panorama.

Leading lines framing draws the eye from the meditation cushion through the deck's planks toward the horizon. Rich natural color grading deepens, showing twilight approaching. Mountains layer in atmospheric perspective, multiple ridges fading into violet distance. The earth-toned clothing blends harmoniously with the natural setting.
